Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines 
that are programmed to think and learn like humans. The term may also be applied to 
any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and 
problem-solving.

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables machines to learn from data without 
being explicitly programmed. Deep Learning is a further subset of machine learning 
that uses neural networks with multiple layers.

Applications of AI include:
1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
2. Computer Vision
3. Robotics
4. Recommendation Systems
5. Healthcare diagnostics

Challenges in AI development include:
- Ethical considerations
- Bias in algorithms
- Data privacy concerns
- Job displacement concerns

Future trends suggest increased integration of AI in everyday life, with advances in 
explainable AI and AI safety research.
